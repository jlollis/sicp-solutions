Exercise 1.30. The sum procedure above generates a linear recursion. The procedure can be rewritten
so that the sum is performed iteratively. Show how to do this by filling in the missing expressions in
the following definition:
(define (sum term a next b)
 (define (iter a result)
   (if <??>
       <??>
 (iter <??> <??>)))
 (iter <??> <??>))
