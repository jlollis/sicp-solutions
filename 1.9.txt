Exercise 1.9.  Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive integers in terms of the procedures inc, which increments its argument by 1, and dec, which decrements its argument by 1.

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a ) b))))

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

	  
Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating (+ 4 5). Are these processes iterative or recursive?

Answer:

First case, process is recursive:

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (inc (+ (dec a ) b))))

(+ 4 5) 
(inc (+ (dec 4) 5)) 
(inc (+ 3 5)) 
(inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5))) 
(inc (inc (+ 2 5))) 
(inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5)))) 
(inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5)))) 
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5))))) 
(inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5))))) 
(inc (inc (inc (inc 5)))) 
(inc (inc (inc 6))) 
(inc (inc 7)) 
(inc 8)

Second case, process is iterative:

(define (+ a b)
  (if (= a 0)
      b
      (+ (dec a) (inc b))))

(+ 4 5) 
(+ (dec 4) (inc 5)) 
(+ 3 6) 
(+ (dec 3) (inc 6)) 
(+ 2 7) 
(+ (dec 2) (inc 7)) 
(+ 1 8) 
(+ (dec 1) (inc 8)) 
(+ 0 9)
