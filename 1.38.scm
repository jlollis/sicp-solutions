Exercise 1.38. In 1737, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler published a memoir De
Fractionibus Continuis, which included a continued fraction expansion for e - 2, where e is the base of
the natural logarithms. In this fraction, the N_i are all 1, and the D_i are successively

1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, ....

Write a program that uses your cont-frac procedure from exercise 1.37 to approximate e, based on Eulerâ€™s expansion.
