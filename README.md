## Setup

For Windows 10, I would highly recommend _[Racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html)_. Install Racket and add the SICP language package. There is also a Linux version available, as well.
 
There are other options, but Racket has gotten really good and is much better than anything else I've come across. It is a really nice IDE for Scheme. 

## Resources

### Official Documentation
[MIT Scheme Reference Manual](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/ftpdir/mit-scheme/7.7/7.7.1/doc-pdf/scheme.pdf) 

### Don't Panic - A Guide for the Perplexed 
* [REPL Tutorial & Debugging](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/dont-panic/#sec-2-1)
  * From the relatively recent [MIT course](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/index.html) using SICP.

## Video Lectures

All of the video lectures for the course are available on MIT OpenCourseware and YouTube. There are 20 lectures total, each about an hour long, which were recorded by Hewlett-Packard Television for HP employees in 1986. The video quality as presented isn't the greatest, but the production is otherwise excellent. To get the most out of them, you will probably want to have the transcripts and code from the lectures up while watching.

## Other Resources

* [CS61](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su10/) Cal Berkeley course from 2010 that uses SICP as the textbook. Helpful for more detailed setup instructions and additional resources.
