# SICP Exercise Solutions

This is a repository for the solutions for the exercises in [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html).

## Setup

For your editor/IDE I would highly recommend using _[Racket](https://racket-lang.org/)_ (formerly DrRacket) with the _SICP language package(https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html)_ installed. 
 
There are other options, but Racket has gotten really good and is much better than anything else I've come across. It is a really nice IDE for Scheme. 

## Resources

### Official Documentation
[MIT Scheme Reference Manual](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/ftpdir/mit-scheme/7.7/7.7.1/doc-pdf/scheme.pdf) 

### Don't Panic - A Guide for the Perplexed 
* [REPL Tutorial & Debugging](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/dont-panic/#sec-2-1)
  * From the relatively recent [MIT course](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/index.html) using SICP.

## Video Lectures

All of the video lectures for the course are available on MIT OpenCourseware and YouTube. There are 20 lectures total, each about an hour long, which were recorded by Hewlett-Packard Television for HP employees in 1986. The video quality as presented isn't the greatest, but the production is otherwise excellent. To get the most out of them, you will probably want to have the transcripts and code from the lectures up while watching.

## Other Resources

* [CS61](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su10/) Cal Berkeley course from 2010 that uses SICP as the textbook. Helpful for more detailed setup instructions and additional resources.
