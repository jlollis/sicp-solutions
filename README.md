## Installing Scheme

There are several options to run Scheme on Windows 10:
 * _[DrRacket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html)_: Install DrRacket and add the SICP language package. 
 * _[MIT-Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/) on WSL_: Install Windows Subsystem for Linux following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). Use the Ubuntu distribution. Install MIT-Scheme with *sudo apt get install mit-scheme*.
 * _[Chicken Scheme](https://www.call-cc.org/) on WSL_: Install WSL Ubuntu. Install Chicken Scheme with *sudo apt get install chicken-bin*. 
 
 I would recommend the first option, because the included text editor makes it easier to start with. [SICP Interpreter Manual for Racket](http://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html)
 
 Note: The Windows executable for MIT-Scheme appears to no longer work in Windows 10.

  * From the relatively recent [MIT course](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/index.html) using SICP.

## Video Lectures

All of the video lectures for the course are available on MIT OpenCourseware and YouTube. There are 20 lectures total, each about an hour long, which were recorded by Hewlett-Packard Television for HP employees in 1986. The video quality as presented isn't the greatest, but the production is otherwise excellent. To get the most out of them, you will probably want to have the transcripts and code from the lectures up while watching.

## Other Resources

* [CS61](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su10/) Cal Berkeley course from 2010 that uses SICP as the textbook. Helpful for more detailed setup instructions and additional resources.
