Exercise 1.36.
Modify fixed-point so that it prints the sequence of approximations it generates,
using the newline and display primitives shown in exercise 1.22.

Then find a solution to x^(x) = 1000 by finding a fixed point of x -> log(1000)/log(x).
Use Schemeâ€™s primitive log procedure, which computes natural logarithms.
Compare the number of steps this takes with and without average damping.

Note: you cannot start fixed-point with a guess of 1, as this would cause division by log(1) = 0.
