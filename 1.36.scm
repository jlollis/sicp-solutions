Exercise 1.36.
Modify fixed-point so that it prints the sequence of approximations it generates,
using the newline and display primitives shown in exercise 1.22.

Then find a solution to x^(x) = 1000 by finding a fixed point of x -> log(1000)/log(x).
Use Schemeâ€™s primitive log procedure, which computes natural logarithms.
Compare the number of steps this takes with and without average damping.

Note: you cannot start fixed-point with a guess of 1, as this would cause division by log(1) = 0.

;; ANSWER:

; fixed-point definition given in chapter section, modified to display guess on new line
(define tolerance 0.00001)

(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
    (< (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance))
  (define (try guess)
    (display guess) ; display guess
    (newline)       ; newline
    (let ((next (f guess)))
      (if (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))

; finds solution to x^(x) = 1000 by finding a fixed point of x -> log(1000)/log(x)
(fixed-point (lambda (x) (/ (log 1000)(log x))) ; x -> log(1000)/log(x)
          2) ; you can't start fixed-point with a guess of 1, as this would cause division by log(1) = 0. [see above]

; Average damping covered in lecture 2A
(define (sqrt x)
	(fixed-point
		(average-damp (lambda (y)(/ x y)))
		1))

(define average-damp
	(lambda (f)
		(lambda (x) (average (f x) x))))

(define (average x y)
  (/ (+ x y) 2))

(fixed-point (lambda (x)(average x (/ (log 1000)(log x)))) ; ; use average-damp process above by modifying fixed-point like average-damp above, in adding average x
          2)

; Applying average damp to MIT scheme native log function takes about a third as many steps to complete than without, as seen below.
