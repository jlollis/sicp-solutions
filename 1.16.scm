; Exercise 1.16. Design a procedure that evolves an iterative exponentiation process that uses
; successive squaring and uses a logarithmic number of steps, as does fast-expt.(Hint: Using the
; observation that((b ^(n/2 ))^2 = ((b^2)^(n/2)), keep, along with the exponent n and the base b,
; an additional state variable a, and define the state transformation in such a way that the product
; a b n is unchanged from state to state. At the beginning of the process a is taken to be 1, and the answer
; is given by the value of a at the end of the process. In general, the technique of defining an invariant
; quantity that remains unchanged from state to state is a powerful way to think about the design of
; iterative algorithms.)
