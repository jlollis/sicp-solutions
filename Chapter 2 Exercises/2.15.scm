Exercise 2.15. Eva Lu Ator, another user, has also noticed the different intervals computed by
different but algebraically equivalent expressions. She says that a formula to compute with intervals
using Alyssaâ€™s system will produce tighter error bounds if it can be written in such a form that no
variable that represents an uncertain number is repeated. Thus, she says, par2 is a "better" program
for parallel resistances than par1. Is she right? Why?
