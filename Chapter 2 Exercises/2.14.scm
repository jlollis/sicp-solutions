Exercise 2.14. Demonstrate that Lem is right. Investigate the behavior of the system on a variety of
arithmetic expressions. Make some intervals A and B, and use them in computing the expressions A/A
and A/B. You will get the most insight by using intervals whose width is a small percentage of the
center value. Examine the results of the computation in center-percent form (see exercise 2.12).
