Exercise 2.6. In case representing pairs as procedures wasn’t mind-boggling enough, consider that, in
a language that can manipulate procedures, we can get by without numbers (at least insofar as
nonnegative integers are concerned) by implementing 0 and the operation of adding 1 as

(define zero (lambda (f) (lambda (x) x)))
(define (add-1 n)
  (lambda (f) (lambda (x) (f ((n f) x)))))

This representation is known as Church numerals, after its inventor, Alonzo Church, the logician who
invented the λ calculus.

Define one and two directly (not in terms of zero and add-1).(Hint: Use substitution to evaluate
(add-1 zero)). Give a direct definition of the addition procedure + (not in terms of repeated
application of add-1).
